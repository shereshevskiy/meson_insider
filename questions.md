1) The descriptions of the features. What mean f__buytransactions_1m , f__selltransactions_1m etc
2) what does mean "1m", "3m", "6m", "12m" in feature names
3) Why after 1m follows 3m and then 6m (and then 12m) in the feature list?
4) As I understand, the "f _..._ 3m" feature (for example) is the aggregation of the corresponding feature for the last 3 months?
5) As I understand, the "f_..._1m", ..., "f_..._12m" are the aggregation the features for the last 3, ..., 12 months?
6) What is f__buysharespctsharesout_1m (and f__sellsharespctsharesout_1m)?
